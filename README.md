## Specifications
| Test | Input | Output |
|--------|:------:|:-----:|
| Describe Calculator |||
| Correctly create new object with user's age | age = 30 | expect Earth age = 30 |
| Correctly calculate Mercury age | age = 30 | expect Mercury age =  125 |
| Correctly calculate Venus age | age = 30 | expect Venus age = 48 |
| Correctly calculate Mars age | age = 30 | expect Mars age = 16 |
| Correctly calculate Jupiter age | age = 30 | expect Jupiter age = 3 |
| Correctly take in user's earth life expectancy | age = 30, expectancy = 80 | expect age = 30, expectancy = 80 |
| Correctly calculate number of years left to live | age = 30 expectancy = 80 | expect 50 |
| Correctly calculate number of years left to live on Mercury | expectancy = 80 | expect 209

Psuedo-psuedo code:
1. Create a class that contains a user's earth age
2. Convert earth age into Mercury age (earth age / .24)
3. Convert earth age into Venus age (earth age / .62)
4. Convert earth age into Mars age (earth age / 1.88)
5. Convert earth age into Jupiter age (earth age / 11.86)
6. Take in user's earth life expectancy
7. Calculate # of years left (earth age - life expectancy)
8. Planet Life expectancy = (earth life expectancy / planet's year conversion)
